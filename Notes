Let us learn about Business Analytics with Excel with the help of a scenario. 
Michael has joined as a business analyst in a company. John, the functional manager, assigns a task to Michael to 
observe the company statistics by checking the company's profit and field of improvements. Michael is new to this 
field and does not have the expertise to analyze data and create valuable insights out of it. To manage and analyze data, 
he must learn the concepts of data cleaning, data preparation, and data visualization. He must acquaint himself with the business 
analytics approach and understand how to remove duplicates and have an overview of formatting in order to provide data analytics
for the company. He must familiarize himself with business analytics tools like Excel to perform specific functions. 
He lacks experience with data visualization. Therefore, he has to learn different functions like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, MATCH, etc. 
He has to put the data in charts and compare the current data with the previous year data. He needs macros to automate tasks that 
he needs to perform repeatedly, which will in turn save him a lot of time. He will need to learn how to use SOLVER ADDIN and 
GOALSEEK to find optimal values and understand what value needs to be in an input cell to achieve a desired result in a formula cell.
He will also have to acquaint himself with the concept of moving average so that he can smooth out the data by reducing the impact of
random fluctuations. Michael will have to understand multiple linear regression so that he can make one plot for each independent 
variable versus the residuals. Through this Michael will subsequently be able to analyze the company's data to derive valuable 
insights and drive better business decisions.
